Word digester: an esay, accurate lemmatizer that also handles words outside dictionaries

The R version has no external dependencies, though it runs slightly faster if you first load the "stringi" package. 

The Python version requires numpy, re, and functools. 

Documentation for both is located within the digest_words(words) function.
