Word digester: an esay, accurate lemmatizer that also handles words outside dictionaries

R version runs slightly faster if you first load the "stringi" package. 
R version requires a few of my utils/ functions that I'll transfer over soon. 

Python version requires numpy, re, and functools. 

Documentation for both is located within the digest_words(words) function.
